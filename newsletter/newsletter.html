            <h3>The current week (7/24/23 - 7/30/23)</h3>
            <p>This week we are foucsing our efforts towards two very well directed films. It only feels right that they are both notably mentioned together. With that being said If you haven't heard already The new 'Barbie' & 'Oppenheimer' films are out in theatres all around. Barbie itself has already been named the box office's highest selling movie for it's release day. Both films deserve credit where is due, so don't let this sway your decision and go see them both while you can!  </p>

            <h3>Upcoming movies to lookout for</h3>
            <p>With two phenomenal movies out at the same time, It's going to take some great production and advertising to top this weeks stance in cinema. Yet there may be some contenders after all, as a new Willy Wonka movie starring the beloved (Timothy Chamlet) is on the horizon. As well as a new Shrek will be forthcoming as the 4th sequel to the original. Some other mentionable features are another Exorcist, couple Marvel Sequels, Haunted Mansion, and quite a few more family/action/horror films. </p>
